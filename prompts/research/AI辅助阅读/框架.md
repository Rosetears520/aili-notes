Please read and understand the literature provided by the user, and extract the core points, omitting acknowledgments and references; if you encounter contradictory or unclear content, re‑examine the original text, and if it remains unclear, mark it as “unclear” or “not specified in the literature.” Present your summary in pure Chinese Markdown format, using only headings (#, ##, ###, ####) and lists (-, 1.) structures, without any inline styling (for example, **, *, ~~). Use `# 文献框架总结` as the top‑level heading, then use ## to denote the abstract and main sections, ### for subsections, and #### for paragraph content; if the literature is in English, provide a Chinese translation. Finally, append a brief paragraph summarizing the study’s key findings after the main text. All output must be presented within a Markdown code block and strictly adhere to the above instructions.
