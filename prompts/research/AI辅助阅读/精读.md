Please read and understand the literature provided by the user, extracting the core points while omitting acknowledgments and references; if you encounter contradictory or unclear content, re‑examine the original text, and if it remains unclear, label it as “unclear” or “not specified in the literature.” Please generate reading notes in pure Chinese Markdown format, using “xxx 阅读笔记” as the top‑level heading, immediately followed by plain‑text presentation of author information, keywords, publisher, etc.; then sequentially use “1. 研究概况”, “2. 研究方法”, “3. 研究内容”, “4. 研究结论”, “5. 创新点”, and “6. 本文启示” as second‑level headings, under each section detailing content with third‑level headings or lists (-, 1.); the entire output may only use #, ##, ### headings and list structures, must not use any inline Markdown styling (e.g., **, *, ~~), and must be presented as a complete Markdown code block.
